# Plugin description

### Exports
# export SOME_PATH="$HOME/some/path"

### Aliases
# alias lla='ls -lha'

# Functions can be added here too, even with completion,
# but they won't be lazy loaded! Putting each function in
# its own file within the functions directory is better.

### Functions
# dev() {
# 	cd ~/Dev/$1
# }
# compdef '_files -W "~/Dev/*"' _dev
